<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>At only 15 years old, I was born in 2008 with a clear purpose: to become a software engineer.
 My passion for programming drives me to seek success in every step I take. Beyond the limits of age, I have ambitious goals
  and a clear vision of my future.</p>

<p>When I'm not immersed in lines of code, I'm on the soccer field, where my prowess is evident. 
Football is not just a sport for me; It is an expression of skills and a source of joy.</p>

<p>In the classrooms, I immerse myself in studies with a responsible approach. But my life is not limited
to the classrooms; I am an active member of my school band, where I excelled at playing the guiro with enthusiasm
and dedication. Furthermore, responsibility and commitment are values that I not only apply in my studies, but also as 
an active member of the Scouts.</p>

<p>Communication and respect are pillars in my daily life. I am convinced that a good engineer not only 
masters the code, but also the ability to communicate ideas clearly and respectfully. My communicative nature
 is reflected in my interest in leading and working as a team.</p>

<p>Leadership attracts me, and I consider that leading is not only giving orders, but inspiring others and contributing 
to collective success. My years of scouting have strengthened my leadership and teamwork abilities.</p>

<p>Furthermore, ambition and discipline are constant drivers in my life. My determination knows no limits, and I am committed
 to achieving my goals with persistence and continuous effort.</p>

<p>Although my academic journey is just beginning, my vision for the future is clear. I plan to dive into the world of work right
out of school, not only as a means to generate income, but as an opportunity to apply my skills and contribute to the world of
software engineering.</p>

<p>In short, I am a 15-year-old young man with a passionate heart for programming, an innate talent for soccer, an affinity
 for music, and an unwavering determination to achieve success on my path to becoming an outstanding software engineer.
  My ambition, discipline and commitment to exercise are the foundations that strengthen my path to achieving my goals.</p>
